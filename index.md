## Favorite CPSC 120L-01 Labs

* Lab 08 Part-2

Lab 08 Part 2 is a a lab where we identify patterns with loops. Using knitting as an example, we use repeating, or looping, operations to create a pattern by decreasing bar count and increasing line number and dash count by using loops. In the code, we have to program the code by writing a for loop and intialize the line in the for loop. We intialize the line by 0, the start. Under the line, we wrote another for loop and intialize dash and setting it as 0. The output would be "-" for dash and "*" for the line. We write another for loop and this time, we intialize bar and set it to 0. The output of bar would be "|". For each loop done, a new line is made by using std::cout << "\n";. This part of the lab was my favorite due to the fact that it's such a small piece of code that can output what seems to be a complicated pattern. With it being such a small piece of code, it is possible to make even more complicated patterns with just a few tweaks to it.

* Lab 10 Part-2

Lab 10 Part 2 is a lab where we calculate the Population Density, Population, and Land Area of a named state. The point of this lab is to draw out information from one folder onto another and using that information to calculate Population Density, Land Area, and Population. We needed to use std::vector< std::vector < std::string>> to draw out information in the state_demographics.csv folder in part-2. This folder included named states, population, and land area. Once we draw out this information, we calculate it to determine which state has the densest and sparsest population density. I found this lab very interesting to me, drawing out info from one folder onto another without needing to write down every single state down in the folder and let the program calcuate it all at once just fascinates me and I could see myself use this for future projects.

* Lab 06 Part-1

My favorite lab yet. The purpose of this lab is to create a sandwich by using the individual components, for example, the first component is to use bread, then protein, then condiment, after that is done, you have to make a output that calls out what component the sandwich has, for example, std::cout << "A " << protein << " sandwich << bread << " with " << condiment << ".\n";. This piece of code is meant for the customer as it list out what they ordered on their sandwich. This lab, similar to Lab 10 Part 2, is my favorite due to me finding potential usefulness in future projects. It can be used to creates planners, alarms, or even security devices, not to mention that it is a simple and small piece of code that can be fully customizable and expandable to be more secure and specific.
